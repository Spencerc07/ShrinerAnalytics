# ShrinerAnalytics
Exploratory analysis for Shriner dataset using Python and R. 

The scripts within this program first preprocess the data. A Principal Component Analysis is then run on 19 variables. The top two of these components explain ~50% of the variance within the data. 

See lib folder for various progams: 
Surgery Scaled.py contains the preprocessing portion of the code. 
PCA.py contains the Principal Component Anaylsis. 
Further graphs and visuals are based on these two files.
